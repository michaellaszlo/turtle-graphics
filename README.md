# Turtle graphics

This library implements 2-D turtle graphics on an HTML canvas. The turtle
is an object that draws a stroke as it moves in the Cartesian plane.

The turtle has a position and an angle. It supports the following
operations:

- forward(distance): move the turtle in the direction of its current angle
- left(radians): turn the turtle clockwise
- right(angle): turn the turtle counterclockwise

The use of the turtle is demonstrated by a small app that lets the user
draw a regular polygon with a given number of sides, with one vertex
anchored at a given point and the rest of the polygon oriented at a
given angle from that point.
