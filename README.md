# Turtle graphics

This library implements 2-D turtle graphics on an HTML canvas.

The turtle is an object that draws a stroke as it moves in the Cartesian
plane. It has a position and an angle. It supports the following
operations:

- **forward(distance)**: move the turtle in the direction of its current angle
- **left(angle)**: turn the turtle clockwise
- **right(angle)**: turn the turtle counterclockwise

The use of the turtle is demonstrated by a small app that lets the
user draw a regular polygon. Initially you are shown a blank Cartesian
plane. Click and drag to define one side of the polygon, and the rest
is drawn automatically. After the polygon has been drawn, you can change
the number of sides by clicking on the minus and plus buttons at right.
